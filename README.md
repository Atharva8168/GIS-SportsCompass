GIS-Based Sports Infrastructure Inventory 🏟️📍

📌 About the Project

This project leverages Geographic Information System (GIS) technology to create a comprehensive inventory of sports infrastructure across different regions. It provides real-time location data, facility details, and accessibility insights, helping athletes, teams, and policymakers make informed decisions. The platform, built as an Android application, integrates Quantum GIS, Google Maps API, and Firebase for seamless mapping and data management.

🔹 Pan-India sports infrastructure inventory for enhanced accessibility
🔹 Geospatial data visualization for informed decision-making
🔹 40% reduction in manual data collection time
🔹 50% improvement in facility accessibility tracking
